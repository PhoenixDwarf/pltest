I decided to choose those four widgets since I only had this day to make them all, I apologize. Those were the more realistic to be made on time. 
I developed all of them following angular best practices and using angular built-in tools such as directives, pipes, modules, components, etc. I tried also to apply styles manually for most of them to demonstrate how good I am with css.
I added a Spanish translation xlf file but I didn’t have enough time to figure how to switch translations in run time, even though it is implemented. 
To run the project open terminal and execute npm install (node.js is required), once that is finished run the command ng serve -o and that’s all.
